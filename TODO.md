TODO LIST
=========

- Member expression for tuple literals (as value and assignment target)

- Tuple unpacking, i.e. var (a, b, c) = tuple

- Describe formal grammar

- Better codegen with SSA and control flow graph

- VM

- Dynamic member lookup for symbols? For example "a.#var" 


Far future
==========

- Register machine instead of stack based vm
